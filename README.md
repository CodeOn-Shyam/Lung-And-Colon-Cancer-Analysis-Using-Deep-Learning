# 🧠 U-Net + ViT16 for Image Segmentation

This project implements a hybrid deep learning model that combines the strengths of **U-Net** and **ViT-Base-16 (Vision Transformer)** for accurate image segmentation. The model is trained for 10 epochs and can be applied to various domains including medical imaging and satellite segmentation.

## 🚀 Features
- 🔄 Hybrid architecture: U-Net encoder-decoder with ViT-based backbone.
- 🎯 Pretrained ViT-Base-16 model for feature extraction.
- 📊 Trained for 10 epochs with customizable settings.
- 📁 Jupyter Notebook-based implementation for easy experimentation.

## 🧪 Training Summary
- **Model**: U-Net with ViT16 backbone
- **Epochs**: 10
- **Backbone**: ViT-Base-16 (pretrained)
